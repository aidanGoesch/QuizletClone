Steps of development

1. Figure out the GUI
    A. Figure out how to display flash cards - show a term and when you click show a definition
    B. Transition from one flashcard to another flashcard when you hit the next arrow and visa versa
        with the back arrow
    C. Make a learn mode
        I. Start with multiple choice options for one term where the answers come from random flashcards in the set
        II. Make something where you can write the answer and check it by hitting enter

NOTE: Maybe add a matching feature in the future

2. Figure out a backend
    A. Let the user make their own flash card sets bu inputting a term and a definition
    B. Let the user save that set for later use (prob write to a csv)
    C. Let the user access old sets that they have saved before (prob read from a csv)


TO DO:
    add a choice to show term or definition first
    chat gpt integration - not possible
